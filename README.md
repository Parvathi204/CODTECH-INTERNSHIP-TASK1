Project: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

Objective: Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

Key steps:
1.Dataset Loading and Preparation:
      The Titanic dataset is loaded, and missing values for critical features like Age, Fare, and Embarked are handled.

2.Feature Selection:
      Relevant predictors, such as Fare, Pclass, SibSp, Parch, and encoded categories, are chosen to estimate passenger age (Age).
3.Model Training:
      The data is split into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is trained using the training set to establish a relationship between features and age.
4.Model Evaluation:
      Predictions on the test data are evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics to assess performance.
5.Visual Insights:
      Two visualizations provide a deeper understanding:
Actual vs. Predicted Age:
      Displays how closely the model's predictions align with the actual values.
Fare vs. Age: 
      Highlights the relationship between ticket price and passenger age.
Unique Aspects:
Comprehensive Preprocessing:
       Careful handling of missing values ensures robust input data.
Feature Engineering: 
       Transforming categorical variables enhances the model's predictive power.
Simple Visualization:
       The project employs clean, intuitive plots to communicate key insights.
Outcomes:
       The project showcases the application of linear regression in predictive modeling, demonstrating its ability to identify patterns in data and provide meaningful age predictions for Titanic passengers. The visualization and evaluation metrics offer actionable insights into the model's reliability.
